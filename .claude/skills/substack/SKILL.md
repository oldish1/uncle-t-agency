# Substack Search & Content Extraction

Two-layer architecture: Firecrawl discovers Substack posts via Google search, Substack's undocumented API extracts full article content with metadata. Zero auth required.

## Setup

```python
import importlib.util, os
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("substack_client",
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(".")), "scripts/substack/client.py"))
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
client = mod.SubstackClient()
```

Or validate:
```bash
python scripts/substack/test_client.py all
```

**No env vars needed.** Uses Firecrawl (already configured) for search, Substack's public endpoints for content.

## Method Reference

| Method | What | Layer |
|--------|------|-------|
| `search(query, limit)` | Find Substack posts on a topic via Google | Firecrawl |
| `list_posts(publication, limit, sort)` | List posts from a known publication | Substack API |
| `get_post(publication, slug, as_text)` | Get full post content + metadata | Substack API |
| `discover_publications(query, limit)` | Find publications writing about a topic | Firecrawl |
| `research(query, max_posts, search_limit)` | Full pipeline: search → discover → extract | Both |

## Full Research Pipeline

```python
result = client.research(
    "AI product management specs",
    max_posts=5,       # how many posts to extract in full
    search_limit=10,   # how many search results to consider
)

print(f"Found {result['search_results_count']} results")
print(f"Extracted {result['extracted_count']} full posts")

for p in result["extracted_posts"]:
    print(f"\n[{p['publication']}] {p['title']}")
    print(f"  {p['wordcount']} words, {p['reactions']}")
    print(f"  {p['body'][:300]}...")
```

### Response Shape

```python
{
    "query": "AI product management specs",
    "search_results_count": 10,
    "search_results": [
        {"title": "...", "url": "...", "publication": "addyo", "slug": "how-to-write-specs"}
    ],
    "extracted_count": 5,
    "extracted_posts": [
        {
            "title": "How to write a good spec for AI agents",
            "slug": "how-to-write-specs",
            "date": "2026-02-14T...",
            "body": "full plain text content...",
            "body_length": 43683,
            "wordcount": 7093,
            "reactions": {"❤": 245},
            "comment_count": 18,
            "publication": "addyo",
            "url": "https://addyo.substack.com/p/how-to-write-specs",
        }
    ]
}
```

## Individual Methods

### Search for Posts

```python
# Find Substack posts on any topic
results = client.search("AI coding agents", limit=10)
for r in results:
    print(f"[{r['publication']}] {r['title']}")
    print(f"  {r['url']}")
```

### Discover Publications

```python
# Find which Substack authors write about a topic
pubs = client.discover_publications("artificial intelligence", limit=10)
for p in pubs:
    print(f"{p['publication']}, {p['url']}")
```

### Browse a Publication

```python
# List recent posts from a known publication
posts = client.list_posts("oneusefulthing", limit=10, sort="new")
for p in posts:
    hearts = p.get("reactions", {}).get("❤", 0)
    print(f"[{hearts} ❤] {p['title']} ({p['wordcount']} words)")

# Also works with sort="top"
top_posts = client.list_posts("pragmaticengineer", limit=5, sort="top")
```

### Read Full Post

```python
# Get full article content as plain text
post = client.get_post("oneusefulthing", "the-shape-of-the-thing")
print(post["title"])
print(post["body"])       # clean plain text (HTML stripped)
print(post["wordcount"])
print(post["reactions"])

# Get raw HTML instead
post_html = client.get_post("oneusefulthing", "the-shape-of-the-thing", as_text=False)
print(post_html["body"])  # raw HTML
```

## Known Publications (AI/Tech)

| Publication | Subdomain | Known For |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| One Useful Thing | `oneusefulthing` | Ethan Mollick, AI strategy and research |
| Pragmatic Engineer | `pragmaticengineer` | Gergely Orosz, software engineering |
| Lenny's Newsletter | `lennysnewsletter` | Product management |
| Stratechery | `stratechery` | Ben Thompson, tech strategy |
| The Gradient | `thegradient` | AI/ML research |
| AI Supremacy | `aisupremacy` | AI industry analysis |

## Rate Limits

| Layer | Limit |
|-------|-------|
| Firecrawl search | Per Firecrawl plan credits |
| Substack API | ~10-20 req/min before 429 |
| Client delay | 2s between Substack API calls |
| Typical research() call | 1 Firecrawl + 3-5 API calls, ~15 seconds |

The client handles rate limiting automatically. On 429, waits 10 seconds and retries.

## Paywalled Content

Free posts return full HTML body. Paywalled (subscriber-only) posts return truncated content. The `audience` field tells you: `"everyone"` = free, `"only_paid"` = paywalled.

## Maintenance

> **Self-improvement rule:** If you used this skill and discovered something not documented here, a gotcha, API quirk, new pattern, or better approach, add it below before finishing your task.

### Known Gotchas

1. Substack's publication search endpoint (`/api/v1/publication/search`) returns empty results as of March 2026. Use Firecrawl `site:substack.com` search instead.
2. The archive endpoint (`/api/v1/archive`) returns a JSON array, not an object. Some publications return multiple JSON objects (streaming response), which can cause parse errors with naive JSON parsing.
3. Publications with custom domains (e.g., `platformer.news` instead of `platformer.substack.com`) need the custom domain in the API URL. The client tries subdomain first, then falls back to custom domain patterns.
4. `body_html` is null in archive list responses. You must call `/api/v1/posts/{slug}` to get full content.
5. Reactions are returned as `{"❤": N}` (heart emoji key, not a count field). Parse with `post.get("reactions", {}).get("❤", 0)`.
6. Sitemaps (`/sitemap.xml`) no longer auto-generate for new Substack publications. Don't rely on them for discovery.
7. RSS feeds at `{pub}.substack.com/feed` only contain the last 10-50 posts and may not include full content.

### Improvement Backlog

- Add cookie-based auth for reading paywalled content from subscribed publications
- Add Substack Notes search when/if an endpoint surfaces
- Consider caching publication metadata to avoid repeated profile lookups
