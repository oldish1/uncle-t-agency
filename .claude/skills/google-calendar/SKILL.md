# Google Calendar

CLI tool at `scripts/calendar_tool.py`. Read and write. Auth via shared Google OAuth module (`scripts/google_auth.py`).

**Account:** Your primary calendar account (authorized during Google OAuth setup)

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Today's events
python scripts/calendar_tool.py today

# Tomorrow's events
python scripts/calendar_tool.py tomorrow

# Next 7 days (grouped by date)
python scripts/calendar_tool.py upcoming --days 7

# Upcoming events in the next N hours (default 4), useful for midday pulse
python scripts/calendar_tool.py upcoming --hours 4

# Search events
python scripts/calendar_tool.py search "team meeting"

# Create a timed event
python scripts/calendar_tool.py create "Team sync" --start "2026-04-01T09:00:00" --end "2026-04-01T09:30:00"

# Create an all-day event
python scripts/calendar_tool.py create "Content day" --date "2026-04-01" --all-day

# Create a time block (focus block, no attendees)
python scripts/calendar_tool.py block "Deep work" --start "2026-04-01T14:00:00" --hours 3

# Update an event
python scripts/calendar_tool.py update EVENT_ID --summary "New title"

# Delete an event
python scripts/calendar_tool.py delete EVENT_ID

# Free/busy windows for a day
python scripts/calendar_tool.py free --date "2026-04-01"
```

## Output Format (reads)

Timed events:
```
HH:MM–HH:MM  Event Title [id: abc123]
             Location (if set)
```

All-day events:
```
2026-04-01 (all day)  Event Title
```

- Times shown in the timezone set in `.env` as TIMEZONE= (default: UTC if not set)
- All calendars accessible to your authorized account appear in read commands

## Notes

- Calendar scopes are in `scripts/google_auth.py`: token already includes them
- If calendar events don't appear, run: `# First: save your OAuth client JSON as credentials/google-client.json
# (console.cloud.google.com → Credentials → OAuth client ID → Desktop app)
python3 scripts/setup_google_oauth.py` to refresh token
- Time blocks use colorId 7 (teal) by default, good visual distinction from meetings
